# JohnCageTimer
This is a small Android App for the performance of "Water Music" by John Cage. 
In this piece, Cage didn't use regular sheet music but timestamps with instructions like "3.505 Tune Radio to 102 and then off".

We couldn't find a timer for Android with big enough digits and displaying tenth of a second so I wrote this for a friend 
who used it for rehearsal and
the performance and he was very pleased with it.

At the beginning of the performance, the performer starts the timer with a tap on "Start Timer".
All UI elements are hidden to allow for the biggest possible font size and power saving mode is disabled.

To stop and reset the counter during rehearsal or at the end of the performance, tap 
the screen once to show the UI elements and then tap "Reset Timer".
